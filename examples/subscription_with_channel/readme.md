This exciting example illustrates how to write a custom subsciption and communicate with it from an Application using a tokio channel.

Tokio is used both as an executor and to create the channel. However, it the example should work with other executors/channels. Feel free to experiment with it.

The example is purposefully trivial to showcase necessary steps to get the subscription to work without any fireworks.
